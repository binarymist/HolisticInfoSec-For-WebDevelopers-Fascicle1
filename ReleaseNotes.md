We address reliability, resilience, integrity, connectivity of the proposed solutions. Verifying that the logs being transferred are in-fact encrypted
* Proactive server monitoring, discuss goals, and the evaluation criteria for the offerings that were evaluated
* Implementation of proactive server monitoring, what works well, what does not
