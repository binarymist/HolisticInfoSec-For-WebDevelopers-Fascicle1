**Lax authentication while querying of NIS maps** (easy for a compromised client to take advantage of), as well as the various daemons each having their own individual issues. Not to mention that misconfiguration of NIS or netgroups can also provide easy holes that can be exploited. NIS databases can also be easily accessed by someone who doesn't belong on your network. How? They simply can guess the name of your NIS domain, bind their client to that domain, and run a ypcat command to get the information they are after.

%% Identify Risks Docker







**As noted by banyan**  
[https://www.banyanops.com/blog/analyzing-docker-hub/](https://www.banyanops.com/blog/analyzing-docker-hub/)  
and the morning paper  
[https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/04/03/a-study-of-security-vulnerabilities-on-docker-hub/](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/04/03/a-study-of-security-vulnerabilities-on-docker-hub/)

**The Docker overview** says: “_Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment_”  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/understanding-docker/)

**The Docker Registry project** is an open-source server side application that lets you store and distribute Docker images  
[https://github.com/docker/distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution)

**Considering these processes run as root**, and have indirect access to most of the Linux Kernel  
[https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.co.nz/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html](https://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.co.nz/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html)

**All before any security is added on top** in the form of LXC, or libcontainer (now opencontainers/runc)  
[https://github.com/opencontainers/runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc)

**The first place to read for solid background** on Linux kernel namespaces is the man-page  
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)

**The hosts mounted `host-path` is shared** with all others that mount `host-path`  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems) 

**If you omit the `host-path`** you can see the host path that was mounted  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#locating-a-volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#locating-a-volume) 

**Further details can be found** at the dockervolumes documentation  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/)

**`PID` namespaces are hierarchically nested** in ancestor-descendant relationships to a depth of up to 32 levels  
[https://lwn.net/Articles/531419/](https://lwn.net/Articles/531419/) 

**The default behaviour can however be overridden** to allow a container to be able to access processes within a sibling container, or the hosts `PID` namespace  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings-pid](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings-pid)

**As an aside, `PID` namespaces give us the functionality** of "_suspending/resuming the set of processes in the container and migrating the container to a new host while the processes inside the container maintain the same PIDs._"  
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html)  
with a handful of commands  
https://www.fir3net.com/Containers/Docker/the-essential-guide-in-transporting-your-docke  
r-containers.html

**A UTS namespace** is the set of identifiers returned by `uname`  
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html)

**When a container is created**, a UTS namespace is copied (`CLONE_NEWUTS` is set)  
https://github.com/docker/libcontainer/blob/83a102cc68a09d890cce3b6c2e5c14c49e6373a0/S  
PEC.md

**When a container is created** with `--uts="host"` a UTS namespace is inherited from the host  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#uts-settings-uts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#uts-settings-uts)

**According to the namespaces man page** "_Objects created in an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are members of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in other IPC namespaces._"  
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)

**This behaviour can be overridden** to allow a (any) container to reuse another containers or the hosts message queues, semaphores, and shared memory via their IPC namespace  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings-ipc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings-ipc)

**You can see using the command** supplied from the CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark  
[https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf](https://benchmarks.cisecurity.org/tools2/docker/CIS_Docker_1.13.0_Benchmark_v1.0.0.pdf)

**There are currently some Docker features** that are incompatible with using user namespaces  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options) 

**Docker engine reference** provides additional details around known restrictions of user namespaces  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-user-namespace-options)

**Cgroups have been available** in the Linux kernel since January 2008 (2.6.24)  
[https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24#head-5b7511c1e918963d347abc8ed4b75215877d3aa3](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24#head-5b7511c1e918963d347abc8ed4b75215877d3aa3)

**According to the Linux man page for capabilities** "_Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled_"  
[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)

**Dan Walsh** who is one of the experts when it comes to applying least privilege to containers, also discusses these  
[http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/10/17/secure-your-containers-with-this-one-weird-trick/](http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/10/17/secure-your-containers-with-this-one-weird-trick/)

**Open Container Initiative (OCI) runC specification**  
https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/6c22e77604689db8725fa866f0f2ec0b3e8c3a07#r  
unning-containers

**As stated on the Docker Engine security page** "_One primary risk with running Docker containers is that the default set of capabilities and mounts given to a container may provide incomplete isolation, either independently, or when used in combination with kernel vulnerabilities._"  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/)

**The core Unix security model** which is a form of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) was inherited by Linux  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control)

**The Unix DAC was designed in 1969**  
[https://www.linux.com/learn/overview-linux-kernel-security-features](https://www.linux.com/learn/overview-linux-kernel-security-features)

**The first version of SecComp** was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in version 2.6.12 (March 8 2005)  
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/tglx/history.git/commit/?id=d949d0ec9c601f2b148be  
d3cdb5f87c052968554

**In order to enable SecComp for a given process**, you would write a `1` to `/proc/<PID>/seccomp`  
[https://lwn.net/Articles/656307/](https://lwn.net/Articles/656307/)

**Then the addition of the `seccomp()`** System call in 2014 to the kernel version 3.17 along with popular applications such as Chrome/Chromium, OpenSSH  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp)

**Docker has disabled about 44 system calls** in its default (seccomp) container profile  
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/)  
[https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json)

**The `keyctl` System call** was removed from the default Docker container profile after vulnerability CVE-2016-0728 was discovered, which allows privilege escalation or denial of service  
[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2016-0728](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2016-0728)

**Twofish** block cipher invented by Bruce Schneier, with the help from a few others, submitted in 1998 to the NIST as a candidate for the AES, to replace DES. It was one of the five finalists in the AES selection process out of 15 submissions. Twofish has no patents and is free for all uses. Key lengths can be 128, 192 or 256 bits. Twofish is also designed to be more flexible than Blowfish.

SSH-2 uses the DH algorithm as it is required (and currently, its only defined) key-exchange method.

**Rainer Gerhards said** “_In rsyslog, every action runs on its own queue and each queue can be set to buffer data if the action is not ready. Of course, you must be able to detect that the action is not ready, which means the remote server is off-line. This can be detected with plain TCP syslog and RELP_“
