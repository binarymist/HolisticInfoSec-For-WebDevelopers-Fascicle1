# Introduction

%% An introduction deals with the subject of the book, supplementing and introducing the text and indicating a point of view to be adopted by the reader. The introduction usually forms a part of the text [and the text numbering system]; the preface does not." (In other words, the arabic numbering of the book (1,2,3) starts with the introduction, if there is one. The other front matter takes i, ii, iii, etc.)

W> Don't wait until you're on the stage, where the cost of your mistakes are at their highest.

When it comes to providing countermeasures to the identified risks, measuring the security posture of an application or network is the step before. The best defence against an attacker is offence. What does that mean? It means your best defence is to have someone with your best interests (generally employed or contracted by you), if we're talking about your assets, assess the vulnerabilities of your assets and attempt to exploit them.

The crux of the Bruce Schneier Sensible Security Model (SSM) can be found [here](http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/quotes/beyond-fear.html).

"MS" identifies a Microsoft resource. "OWASP" identifies an "Open Web Application Security Project" resource.

Iterate on the 30,000' view, then iterate on each of the 10,000' views that are applicable for your specific domain and system.

I've used a similar graphic set that the OWASP Top 10 uses for vulnerabilities through out the book for the risk in the following vein:  
Exploitability: [EASY|AVERAGE|DIFFICULT|VERY DIFFICULT]  
Prevalence: [VERY WIDESPREAD|WIDESPREAD|COMMON|UNCOMMON]  
Detectability: [DIFFICULT|AVERAGE|EASY|VERY EASY]  
Impact: [SEVERE|MODERATE|LOW]  

Then for the countermeasures again following OWASP's lead:  
Prevention: [DIFFICULT|AVERAGE|EASY|VERY EASY].

Where ever you see the following fiddling devil. It means it's hands on attack sequence time:
